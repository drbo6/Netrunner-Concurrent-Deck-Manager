  <notes><![CDATA[**&quot;Who needs influence anyways?&quot;**

After Belgian Nats I knew my Conduit Aenas Lat deck was just not cutting it, and I needed an emergency backup runner for Worlds. I saw that my young Padawan AlPi had great succes with Deep Dive Lat, but I also knew I needed something more aggressive to fit my playstyle. So I decided to update an old startup deck of mine &quot;Triple Deep Dive Sable&quot;.

It went 5-2 at the French nationals, and 6-2 at Worlds. And just to be correct, at the French nationals I was playing a [Concerto](/en/card/33075) instead of the third [Jailbreak](/en/card/30028).

The oversimplified gameplan is to run once each turn with a run event on your mark, getting random accesses, while applying pressure and often gaining value as well. And later in the game set up the double [Deep Dive](/en/card/33022) turn, where you can even steal a second agenda in one those two. Which turns out to be a pretty good finisher. 

[Backstitching](/en/card/33019) is the real MVP here, letting you face-check with impunity on your mark, as well as bypass the bigger ICE in the late game such as BrÃ¢n and Pharos.

And yes, the draw is abysmal, but what else are you gonna do with your 6 clicks a turn.]]></notes>
