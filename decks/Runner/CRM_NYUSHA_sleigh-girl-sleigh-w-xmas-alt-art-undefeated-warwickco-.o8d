  <notes><![CDATA[After UK Nats, I wanted to try experimenting with [Swift](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/27002) [Sable](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33011) instead of my loyal [Hermes](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/34014). I was feeling that more running clicks might be more aggressive than the Corp having fewer cards out. I am now a Swift convert.

This deck was undefeated at the [Warwick 2023 CO “A Very Christmas Netrunner”]( https://alwaysberunning.net/tournaments/3971/warwick-uni-h2-co-a-very-netrunner-christmas) (4/4) and secured me fourth place overall in a very tight field. My parallel
[Corp List](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/3f6096c4-4641-42dd-ae87-95cfeea4b458/gift-tags-for-christmas-w-kanehl-4th-warwick-co-) is here. 


 The Decklist 

After a little netrunnerDB scouring, and a brief and painful attempt to try and play [Zayha](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30010), I was drawn to [this list](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/0af65078-2335-44be-9b3d-9d48d863cebf/13th-worlds-1st-french-nats-triple-deep-dive-sable) which won French Nats. The lists main attraction is a triple [Deep Dive](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33022), but overall seemed [slick](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26018), did [everything](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33019) I wanted it to, so I thought, hey, let’s give this thing a [spin](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31037). Thanks so for sharing your list [Ryanbantwins](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/6406/ryanbantwins). 

 Alt Art  

The tournament invited Christmas adaptation, and so I made a full set of festive alt arts for Rybantwins list. 

Doing this was my first dabble at modifying Netrunner cards and it really made me appreciate the talent of the artists who made the cards I was using. It&#039;s amazing! So thanks to all of those creators for making such amazing art, and I hope you don&#039;t mind my lil Xmas Remix! 🎄 🎄 🎄 🎄

You are all welcome to use them however you like - happy holidays!

 Deck Notes  
Overall, the deck offers great crim lines.

I played Deep Dive differently in different matchups: Getting a pair of singles dispatched in one match, a few turns apart from one another; in another match I double Deep Dived thanks to the 6 click Swift turn, and won out that way. 

Bravado is a cracker, Carpe Diem sleighs all day, Backstitching is a wonderful gift. 

To change, I wonder if [Inside Job](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31018) is pulling its weight in this deck, it’s good but not great. I also never used [Revolver](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33018), favouring [Mutual Favour](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30011) for [Carmen](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30015) every. single. time. 

Gratitudes 

Huge thanks to [Ryanbantwins](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/6406/ryanbantwins) for sharing your list.

Thanks to [znsolomon](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/20238/znsolomon) for driving us in a day of travel chaos, and also for facing off against me in the final round of the day with such good energy. We smashed it! 

Thanks also to my wonderful local meta, for testing and teaching me how to play netrunner. I have only been playing since the end of July and you&#039;ve all been very patient, generous, and kind! Having your own Quear Earth Hub is a powerful thing. So proud of everyone for all your successes this year. Congratulations to [SeaRose](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/43803/SeaRose) for your win at the CO, I know you will make the Midlands proud at the Circuit Breaker Invitational! 

Finally, a massive shout out to [harmonbee](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/8221/harmonbee) for making such a fun tournament. The theme inspired so much creativity ([not_yeti’s](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/39463/not_yeti) beard! Scruff’s alt arts!), the community felt so supported by your efforts, and you and [AceEmpress](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/36183/AceEmpress) brought us all so much festive cheer with your story performance. Amazing all round. 

Bring on 2024!]]></notes>
