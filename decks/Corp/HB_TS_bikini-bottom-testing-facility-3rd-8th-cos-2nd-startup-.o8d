This is the deck I brought to Worlds for the Crown of Servers and Startup Championship. I went 8-2 over both day loosing only to Pinsel playing my own [Runner deck](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/1bc216f4-80e4-4db6-a56a-87c8d494f57d/cats-orca-1rst-8th-cos-2nd-startup-championship-) and Startup- Champion Tradon on [Zahya](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/45e4e2a8-df0c-42b0-9df4-a144d4e922b0/who-needs-a-boat-anyways-1-at-startup-worlds-2023). I convinced lostgeek to play it at CoS as well were he also went 4-1 with the deck getting 3rd place with his team.

Preparing for Startup I made a few observations:

- Boat is legal -&gt; Ice is bad, scoring agendas in a remote is bad
- Drago is legal, but every Runner techs heavily for him, so it is much less impactful
- This generally felt like a Runner favoured Meta to me
- Clot is legal, but no SimulChip or SMC. Despite this there are no good FA Strategies
- There are no defensive Agendas, making Centrals incredibly soft
- People have no idea how to play against Thule

These observations let me to this list. It is a bit cheesy and would probably loose a bunch of its power in an open-decklist-cut against prepared opponents, but it is very good in Swiss against unprepared runners (and is much less of a known entity like Kill-NEH).


The deck essentially presents a very simple Fork for the runner:


Early game you can leave centrals very light (against run-econ crim some ice to keep them from getting value is important) as Thule and Nightmare make running Centrals very unattractive. Build a remote with [Hendriks](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33103) and [Skunkworks](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30042) and ice it either with [Pulse](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33099) to tax clicks further or [some](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/34034) [gear](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/34044) [check](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31044). Try to score a [Salvo](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/34031) in there asap. Most runners won&#039;t even contest (especially if you don&#039;t advance because you have two [Seamless](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30040) in Hand) and when they do they hopefully take 2 core damage in [the process](https://the-process.org/). 

After that ice up Centrals and dig for [Elivagar](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33031) for the 2nd core and then more Elivagar or [Ontos](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/33096) to close out the game. The ice suite here is not designed to keep the runner out but to be cheap and as annoying as possible.

Huge shoutout to all the folks at NSG who made the whole Worlds Weekend possible.

Also thanks to the NWE folks for being amazing people.]]></notes>
