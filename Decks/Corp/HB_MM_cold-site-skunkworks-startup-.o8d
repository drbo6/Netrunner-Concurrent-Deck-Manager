  <notes><![CDATA[The last months I have mainly been playing Startup format. Getting a bit bored with the identities I had been playing I wanted to try out something new.
I remembered that [Cold Site Server](/en/card/26038) used to combo ok with [MirrorMorph: Endless Iteration](/en/card/26031), especially with [Red Level Clearance](/en/card/26037). Throw some [Subliminal Messaging](/en/card/31082) into the mix, and we have a deck!

It did surprisingly good, so I decided to post it here.

If you have a server with [Tranquility Home Grid](/en/card/26105) in it, a turn could look like this:
1. Play operation: [Red Level Clearance](/en/card/26037) to install a [Cold Site Server](/en/card/26038), gain a click to click the CSS
2. Install [Project Vitruvius](/en/card/02051)
3. Click CSS
You can also have CSS along with [Manegarm Skunkworks](/en/card/30042) for further protection. 
When you click your CSS it is fairly obvious what is going on, so never-advancing is possible with [Seamless Launch](/en/card/30040), but why not give yourself a vitruvious counter instead to bring seamless or RLC back?

Also remember that clicking two different [Cold Site Server](/en/card/26038)s are two different actions, so installing multiple CSS in the same remote might seem unintuitive, but with a [Tranquility Home Grid](/en/card/26105) you are happy to have more targets for the same server. I won a game by installing [Project Vacheron](/en/card/26097) click 1, click CSS click 2, click a second CSS click 3 and then gain a click to click the 3rd one :) That is probably more fun than good, but it won me the game :)

The deck is pretty solid, even though it stands as i threw it together in literally 5 minutes, but if you like it, push the ]]></notes>
