  <notes><![CDATA[[PDX Circuit Opener 2022](https://alwaysberunning.net/tournaments/3396/pdx-circuit-opener-2022) 2nd place of 17

3 - 1 in swiss

1 - 2 in top cut

Paired with [Lat: Ethical Freelancer](/en/decklist/b7409874-6c47-4c3f-8ef9-34665f38051e/-startup-orb-s-last-dance-2nd-place-pdx-circuit-opener) (3-1, 2-0)

Startup right now is a hostile place for corps, but [PD](/en/card/30035) is always a solid standby and [NEXT Activation Command](/en/card/26103) is really well positioned against the [Endurance](/en/card/33025)/[Boomerang](/en/card/26075)/[Botulus](/en/card/30004) meta. Despite that, I was unconvinced in my ability to pilot traditional PD decks to success with both [Pinhole Threading](/en/card/33013) around to knock out defensive upgrades and continuous losses to [Hoshiko](/en/card/26066) [Twinning](/en/card/33010) in testing. I figured if all corps are doing poorly, including a few dirty tricks could maybe steal a couple wins during swiss to sneak into the top cut.

To that end, I cut the [Anoetics](/en/card/30050) and went in on [Saisentan](/en/card/26044) and [Ganked!](/en/card/26119) to either get some free flatlines on turn 1/2 or get a late game blowout when my opponent is forced to contest through a [NEXT](/en/card/26103) turn. [Saisentan](/en/card/26044) never connected through the whole event but the [Ansel 1.0](/en/card/30038) + [Ganked!](/en/card/26119) pseudo-apocalypse came through once in swiss against [Hoshiko](/en/card/26066) and once in the top cut versus [Lat](/en/card/26019).

The [Saisentans](/en/card/26044) ended up feeling pretty bad against a room of [Bukhgalter](/en/card/26016) and [Afterimage](/en/card/26079), and the [Magnets](/en/card/10103), while good against some anarch tools, felt miserable against [Hyperbaric](/en/card/33026) and [Buzzsaw](/en/card/30005). Scoring was instead reliant almost entirely on a stack of bioroids with a bunch of upgrades behind it and a few good [lockdowns](/en/card/26103).

 [Nico Campaign](/en/card/30037) was also nearly useless and would have served me much better as [Regolith Mining License](/en/card/30071) instead.

The real MVP of the day however was [Digital Rights Management](/en/card/26117). This deck is especially susceptible to [R&amp;D](/en/card/33010) [Lock](/en/card/26004) and it both let me find agendas when needed and bluff jamming into the remote.

Once again, thanks mystermerry for setting up the event, and big congrats to benticurus for the first place finish!]]></notes>
