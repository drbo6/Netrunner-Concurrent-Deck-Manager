  <notes><![CDATA[**Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.**

A last month [SirLoathing](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/34223/SirLoathing) published a really fun [Stealth Az deck](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/66754/-startup-sneaky-boys-don-t-gamble-with-full-guide-) that eventually became deck of the week. It&#039;s an amazing combo deck built around Q-Loop and Masterwork, installing hardware mid-run, breaking into servers with seemingly no credits and getting out of [sticky](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30042) [situations](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30050) with [Lucky Charm](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26014). Go check it out, give it a like and take it for a spin!

**One problem: his deck gave me a headache**

Seriously. He wasn&#039;t kidding when he described it as a rube goldberg machine! Playing against a friend, I ended up sitting there for minutes brainstorming on how to break into servers and sometimes I ran out of [stealth credits](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26081) (since I was using it too often to pay for installations). I needed to dumb it down a little and get off the ground a little faster to keep up with [PD](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30035) or other rush decks. 

As I started cutting some of the [hardware](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26013) (which decreased [Aesop&#039;s Pawnshops](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31035) usefulness), and added more events, I realized that [Az](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26010) might not be the best ID for the deck I was working towards. I think this deck could work with [Zahya](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30010) with some minor tweaks, but just doesn&#039;t have enough run events to justify [Ken](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31013). 

**Enter Steve Cambridge**

[Steve](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31014) solved a bunch of problems I was having. His ability let&#039;s you bring back [Penumbral Toolkit](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26081) and install it for free which helps fuel our [stealth](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26079) [rig](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26089) and helps pay for trashing assets, or [steals](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26114), and recur a bunch of [powerful](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26074) [run](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31018) [events](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31037). 

We still rely on [Q-Loop](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26077) to look at the top of our deck giving us extra knowledge and help install key breakers, [Boomerang](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26075), or even [Pennyshaver](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30014).

**Masterwork vs Pennyshaver**

Speaking of Pennyshaver... with more run events and less hardware, [Masterwork](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26015), started to not pull its weight. The draw just was not enough and losing the Az discount meant we were paying a tax for the privilege to install from hand. After playing a few games with Pennyshaver, I found it to be a better fit. It provides a burst to threaten remotes and keep getting us back into HQ to trigger Steve&#039;s ability.

To compensate for the lack of draw, I added [Earthrise Hotel](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31039) and [Jailbreaks](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30028). Jailbreak is great, because it works surprisingly well when combined with [Mu Safecracker](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26076). Who needs [Legwork](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31019), or [Maker&#039;s Eye](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31029)?

To help cover our more expensive resources [Career Fairs](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/31015) rounds out our econ support. If you draw it late use it to pay for your Toolkits for free without the HQ run discount.

**It&#039;s not about the destination, it&#039;s about the journey**

Thanks for reading about my deckbuilding adventure. I recently returned to Netrunner with the launch of System Gateway early this year. The NISEI team knocked it out of the park. I&#039;ve been trying to get anyone interested in card games that I know to give it a try. It&#039;s been such a joy to rediscover the game and play with some old friends. We even started a podcast, [Retromancer](https://retromancer.podbean.com/), if you have time check us out!

**Finally, again, shout-out to [SirLoathing for his amazing Az deck](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/66754/-startup-sneaky-boys-don-t-gamble-with-full-guide-). I appreciate your great decks and write-ups.**]]></notes>
